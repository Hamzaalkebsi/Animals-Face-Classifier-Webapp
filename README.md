🐾 Animal Face Classifier Web App
This project is a deep learning-based web application that detects animal faces and classifies them into three categories: Cat, Dog, or Wild (Lion, Tiger, Cheetah, Fox).

🔍 Features
Upload an image containing an animal face.

The app detects the face and predicts the animal type.

Real-time classification using a trained PyTorch model.

Simple and user-friendly web interface.

🧠 Technologies Used
PyTorch – for building and training the CNN model.

Kaggle Dataset – Animal Faces Dataset by Andrew Mvd.

Flask / Streamlit – for the web interface (mention the one you used).

OpenCV / PIL – for image preprocessing.

🐕 Dataset
The model was trained using the Animal Faces Dataset, which includes labeled images of cats, dogs, and wild animals (lion, tiger, cheetah, fox).

🚀 How to Use
Clone the repository.

Install dependencies from requirements.txt.

Run the web app using:
  python app.py
